**goping** is a high-performance CLI utility written in Go for quick checking and pinging modern configuration links (including subscription links from web sources).

---

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Most popular clients and desktop tools suffer from the same issues:
* **Slow downloads & laggy UI:** When dealing with hundreds or thousands of configs, traditional GUIs freeze or take minutes to finish.
* **Inaccurate ping data:** Standard ICMP or basic TCP checks often yield false results.
* **Long timeouts:** Unnecessary waiting times for non-responsive endpoints.

**goping** solves this by performing **parallel TCP Byte-Handshake checks** using Go goroutines — giving you realistic latency measurements in milliseconds without UI overhead.

## Features

- **High Speed:** Concurrent checks powered by Go channels & goroutines.
- **Accurate Handshake Testing:** Real byte-level handshake evaluation (not basic socket connection checks).
- **Subscription Support:** Direct URL loading and automatic Base64 parsing.
- **Multi-Protocol Ready:** Designed for modern protocols (VLESS, Trojan, Shadowsocks, etc.).
- **Smart Sorting:** Fast alive nodes ranked at the top, dead nodes listed at the bottom.
- **Clear Diagnostics:** Informative error logging so you know exactly what went wrong.
